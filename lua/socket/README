This directory stores the bundled binary LuaSocket library used by Textadept's
Lua state. It is not intended to be used by the external Lua scripts being
debugged. LuaSocket must be installed separately for use by external Lua
interpreters.

Note that while Textadept invokes the external Lua interpreter with a
`package.path` (NOT `package.cpath`) pointing to this directory's parent, it is
only meant for picking up the *mobdebug.lua* module so that the client machine
need not have it installed. This `package.path` setting will incidentally pick
up *socket.lua*, but since it's a Lua script, there shouldn't be any version
issues. *socket.core* should point to where the external Lua interpreter finds
its local copy of LuaSocket, not here.
